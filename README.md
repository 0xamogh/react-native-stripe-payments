A well typed React Native library providing support for Stripe payments on both iOS and Android.

# React Native Stripe payments

## Getting started

> Starting September 14, 2019 new payments regulation is being rolled out in Europe, which mandates Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for many online payments in the European Economic Area (EEA). SCA is part of the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

This library provides simple way to integrate SCA compliant Stripe payments into your react native app with a first class Typescript support.
